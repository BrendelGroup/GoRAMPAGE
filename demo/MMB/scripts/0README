To run the example described in the chapter, you may do the following:
(we'll assume that you have cloned the GoRAMPAGE directory into ~/)

1) Go to some clean work directory and run the prep_script bash commands in the directory, e.g.

	mkdir ~/test
	cd ~/test
	cp ~/GoRAMPAGE/demo/MMB/scripts/* ./
	./prep_script

2) Edit GoRAMPAGE_script_MMB.sh and set the following variables:

	GoRAMPAGEhome	to your home for GoRAMPAGE (~/GoRAMPAGE in this example)
	workdir		to your current work directory (~/test in this example)

   Similarly, edit TSRchitect_*MMB.R and replace instances (on top of the files) of

	GoRAMPAGEhome	with your home for GoRAMPAGE (~/GoRAMPAGE in this example)
	WORKDIR		with your current work directory (~/test in this example)

3) Now you should be set to run the tasks (in order):

	./GoRAMPAGE_script_MMB.sh
	Rscript TSRchitect_serial_MMB.R

   (or use the parallel version for the TSRchitect script if you have the resources to do so).
