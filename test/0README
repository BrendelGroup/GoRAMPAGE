#Suggested test run:

xruntest >& err

#To show progress you may want to:

tail -f err

# ... cancel with CTRL-C
#Run xclean to reset everything.  Consider running the workflow stepwise
#by adding --runonlystep step1 (then: step2, etc.) to the GoRAMPAGE command.
#Help:

../scripts/GoRAMPAGE -h

#To analyze GoRAMPAGE output, you will want to install the Bioconductor package
#TSRchitect (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/TSRchitect.html).
#Once installed, you can turn the GoRAMPAGE generated read alignments into promoter
#predictions.  See TSRchitect documentation and run the following command to explore
#the test data:

Rscript followup.Rscript
